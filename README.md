# EXPERIMENT 17
### AIM
To study and implement linked list
### THEORY
A linked list is a basic data structure in computer science that stores a collection of elements, with each element (node) pointing to the next one, forming a sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists have dynamic memory allocation, which allows them to grow and shrink as needed.<br>
*Types of Linked Lists* <br>
1. **Singly Linked List**: Each node points to the next node in the list, and the last node points to nullptr. <br>
2. **Doubly Linked List**: Each node points to both the next and the previous node, allowing traversal in both directions. <br>
3. **Circular Linked List**: The last node points back to the first node, forming a circle. <br>
### CODE & OUTPUT
