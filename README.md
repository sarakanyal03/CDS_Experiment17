# EXPERIMENT 17
### AIM
To study and implement linked list
### THEORY
A linked list is a basic data structure in computer science that stores a collection of elements, with each element (node) pointing to the next one, forming a sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists have dynamic memory allocation, which allows them to grow and shrink as needed.<br>

1. Types of Linked Lists <br>
* ___Singly Linked List___: Each node points to the next node in the list, and the last node points to nullptr. <br>
* ***Doubly Linked List***: Each node points to both the next and the previous node, allowing traversal in both directions. <br>
* ***Circular Linked List***: The last node points back to the first node, forming a circle. <br>

2. Basic Operations  <br>
* ***Insertion:*** Adding a node to the list at the beginning, middle, or end.  <br>
* ***Deletion:*** Removing a node from the list based on its value or position.  <br>
* ***Traversal:*** Visiting each node in the list to display or process its data.  <br>
